# align-affine: Sequence alignment with affine gap penalties

This package has been forked from [robinp/align](https://github.com/robinp/align). It uses an affine gap penalty model and provides both pairwise alignment and multi-sequence (Center Star) alignment algorithms.

This packge is on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/align-affine-0.1.0.0).
